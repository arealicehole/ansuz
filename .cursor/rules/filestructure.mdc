This is the file structure that needs to be maintained and if it needs to change it needs to be documented Here

Okay, here's a comprehensive layout of a potential file structure for the Ansuz project, assuming a Python-based application (common for scripting, text processing, and API integrations). This structure aims for modularity and clarity, suitable for an MVP and scalable for future enhancements.

Detailed File Descriptions:

Root Directory (ansuz/)

.gitignore:

Purpose: Tells Git which files or directories to ignore in version control.

Content: Patterns for compiled files (*.pyc), virtual environment directories (venv/, env/), sensitive files (config/settings.ini if it contains actual keys, though often a template settings.ini.example is committed), outputs/ directory if generated files aren't versioned, IDE-specific files, OS-specific files.

README.md:

Purpose: Provides a comprehensive overview of the Ansuz project.

Content:

Project name and brief description.

Problem it solves.

Features (MVP and planned).

Prerequisites (e.g., Python version, pip).

Setup instructions (e.g., git clone, pip install -r requirements.txt, configuring API keys).

Usage instructions (CLI commands, options).

Examples.

Contribution guidelines (if applicable).

License information.

requirements.txt:

Purpose: Lists all Python dependencies required for the project to run.

Content: A list of package names and optionally versions (e.g., requests==2.25.1, openai, youtube-transcript-api). Generated typically by pip freeze > requirements.txt.

Main Application File

main.py:

Purpose: The primary entry point for running the Ansuz application, especially if it's a Command Line Interface (CLI).

Functionality:

Parses command-line arguments (e.g., input type, input value, output path) using a library like argparse.

Orchestrates the overall workflow:

Initializes necessary components (e.g., config loader).

Calls src.input_handler to get the transcript source.

If YouTube URL, calls src.youtube_fetcher.

Passes transcript to src.llm_processor.

Passes LLM output and original transcript to src.content_structurer.

Passes structured content to src.html_generator.

Saves the output HTML file (e.g., to the outputs/ directory).

Handles top-level error catching and user feedback (e.g., "Processing complete", "Error occurred").

May include basic logging setup.

Source Code Directory (src/)

__init__.py:

Purpose: Makes the src directory a Python package, allowing modules within it to be imported using src.module_name.

Content: Can be empty or can contain package-level initializations or imports.

input_handler.py:

Purpose: Manages all types of user input for transcripts.

Functionality:

Function to accept and validate a YouTube URL.

Function to read transcript content from a .txt file path.

Function to accept pasted raw text.

Returns the raw transcript string and its source type.

youtube_fetcher.py:

Purpose: Dedicated to fetching transcripts from YouTube videos.

Functionality:

Takes a YouTube URL as input.

Uses a library (e.g., youtube-transcript-api) to retrieve the transcript.

Handles API errors (e.g., video not found, no transcript available, private video).

Returns the transcript text or raises an appropriate exception.

llm_processor.py:

Purpose: Handles all interactions with the Large Language Model (LLM).

Functionality:

Loads LLM API keys and model configurations (via config_loader).

Constructs appropriate prompts for topic segmentation, heading generation, and ensuring content preservation (prompts might be loaded via config_loader).

Sends requests to the LLM API.

Parses the LLM's response to extract structured information (e.g., list of topics with their corresponding text segments and generated headings).

Handles LLM API errors (e.g., rate limits, API down, invalid response).

content_structurer.py:

Purpose: Takes the raw transcript and the LLM's analysis to create the final organized structure of the content.

Functionality:

Receives the original transcript text and the structured output from the llm_processor (e.g., identified topic blocks and their headings).

Organizes the original transcript segments under the LLM-generated topic headings.

Ensures original wording is maintained and no information is lost during this re-organization.

Outputs an intermediate data structure (e.g., a list of dictionaries, each representing a topic with its heading and content) ready for HTML generation.

html_generator.py:

Purpose: Generates the final reader-friendly HTML document.

Functionality:

Takes the structured content from content_structurer.

Uses HTML templating (can be simple string formatting for MVP, or a library like Jinja2 for more complex needs later) to create the HTML.

Applies basic CSS for readability (headings, paragraphs, font, line spacing). CSS can be inline, in a <style> block, or potentially loaded from a separate file in future iterations.

Returns the complete HTML content as a string.

config_loader.py:

Purpose: Centralizes loading of configuration settings.

Functionality:

Reads API keys, LLM model names, default file paths, etc., from config/settings.ini.

Reads LLM prompt templates from config/prompts.json.

Provides functions or a configuration object to access these settings throughout the application.

Handles cases where config files or specific settings might be missing.

utils.py:

Purpose: Contains shared utility functions, constants, or small helper classes used across multiple modules.

Functionality (Examples):

Timestamp generation for output filenames.

Basic text cleaning functions (if needed before LLM processing).

Path manipulation helpers.

Global constants (e.g., default output directory name).

Simple logging configuration helper.

Configuration Directory (config/)

settings.ini (or config.yaml, .env):

Purpose: Stores configuration variables that might change between deployments or users, or are sensitive.

Content (Example for .ini):

[API_KEYS]
OPENAI_API_KEY = YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY_HERE

[LLM_SETTINGS]
MODEL_NAME = gpt-3.5-turbo
TEMPERATURE = 0.5

[PATHS]
DEFAULT_OUTPUT_DIR = outputs/
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Ini
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

Note: This file (if containing actual keys) should typically be in .gitignore. A settings.ini.example with placeholder values should be committed instead.

prompts.json (or prompts.yaml):

Purpose: Stores LLM prompt templates externally for easy modification without changing code.

Content (Example for .json):

{
  "topic_segmentation": "System: You are an expert at analyzing conversation transcripts...\nUser: Here is a transcript:\n{transcript_text}\nYour task is to...\nFormat your output as...",
  "another_prompt_type": "..."
}
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Json
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

Output Directory (outputs/)

Purpose: The default location where Ansuz saves the generated HTML files.

Content: This directory will be populated with .html files as the application processes transcripts (e.g., processed_transcript_20231027103045.html).

Note: This directory is typically created by main.py if it doesn't exist. It's often added to .gitignore if the generated files are not meant to be version controlled.

Sample Data Directory (data/)

Purpose: Contains sample input files useful for development, manual testing, and demonstrations.

Content:

sample_transcript_short.txt: A brief example transcript.

sample_transcript_long.txt: A more extensive example transcript.

sample_youtube_urls.txt: A file containing a few example YouTube URLs, one per line.

Tests Directory (tests/)

__init__.py: Makes tests a Python package.

test_*.py files:

Purpose: Contain unit tests for corresponding modules in src/ using a testing framework like pytest or Python's built-in unittest.

Functionality:

test_input_handler.py: Tests various input scenarios (valid/invalid URLs, file existence, empty text).

test_youtube_fetcher.py: Tests fetching transcripts, handling errors (might require mocking external API calls).

test_llm_processor.py: Tests prompt construction, response parsing, error handling (definitely requires mocking LLM API calls).

test_content_structurer.py: Tests the logic of organizing content based on mock LLM outputs.

test_html_generator.py: Tests if HTML is generated correctly for given structured content.

fixtures/:

Purpose: Stores test-specific data, such as sample input data for tests or mock responses from external services (like a sample JSON response from an LLM).

sample_llm_response.json: An example of what an LLM might return, used to test llm_processor.py parsing or content_structurer.py logic without actual API calls.

This structure provides a solid foundation for building Ansuz. It separates concerns, promotes reusability, and makes the project easier to understand, maintain, and test.
