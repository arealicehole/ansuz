Okay, I've updated the PRD to reflect the project name "Ansuz".

Product Requirements Document: Ansuz

# Overview

Ansuz is a script or application designed to transform raw conversation transcripts (from sources like YouTube or direct text input) into a reader-friendly, topic-organized HTML document.

Problem Solved: Many users encounter long-form audio/video content (e.g., podcasts, lectures, long YouTube videos) where they prefer or need to consume the information by reading rather than watching or listening. Raw transcripts are often dense, unstructured, and difficult to navigate. Ansuz aims to make such content accessible and digestible in a readable format.

Target Audience:

Individuals who want to quickly grasp the key topics and information from long videos or audio without committing hours to watching/listening.

Researchers or students needing to review and reference spoken content efficiently.

Content creators or users who wish to share the essence of a long conversation or presentation with others in an easy-to-read format using Ansuz.

Users with auditory processing difficulties or those in environments where audio consumption is not feasible.

Value Proposition: Ansuz provides a time-saving and accessible alternative to consuming long-form spoken content. By organizing information thematically while preserving the original wording, it allows users to efficiently extract value and insights from lengthy transcripts.

# Core Features (MVP)

The MVP for Ansuz will focus on delivering a functional tool that achieves the primary goal of transforming transcripts into organized, readable HTML.

Feature: Transcript Input (Text/File)

What it does: Allows users to provide a transcript to Ansuz either by pasting raw text directly into the application or by uploading a transcript file (e.g., .txt).

Why it's important: Provides a fundamental way to get transcript data into Ansuz for users who already have the transcript.

How it works at a high level:

User interface (CLI or simple GUI for Ansuz) provides an option to paste text or select a file.

Ansuz reads the text content into memory for processing.

Basic validation (e.g., checking if input is empty) may occur.

Feature: YouTube Link Input & Transcript Fetching

What it does: Allows users to provide a standard YouTube video URL to Ansuz. The application will then attempt to fetch the publicly available transcript for that video.

Why it's important: Streamlines the process for a common source of long-form content, removing the manual step of finding and downloading a transcript before using Ansuz.

How it works at a high level:

User interface provides an option to paste a YouTube URL.

Ansuz uses a library or API (e.g., youtube-transcript-api or similar) to request the transcript associated with the URL.

Error handling for cases where a transcript is unavailable, private, or the URL is invalid.

The fetched transcript text is then passed to Ansuz's processing module.

Feature: LLM-Powered Contextual Understanding & Topic Segmentation

What it does: Ansuz analyzes the full input transcript to understand its global context, identify distinct topics or segments of discussion, and determine logical breaks.

Why it's important: This is the core intelligence of Ansuz, enabling the shift from a chronological, raw dump to a thematically organized document.

How it works at a high level:

The entire transcript is sent to a Large Language Model (LLM).

The LLM is prompted to identify main topics, sub-topics, and logical breakpoints in the conversation.

The LLM should also be instructed to generate concise, descriptive headings for these identified topics/segments.

The process aims to understand the flow and structure of the conversation as a whole.

Feature: Content Organization & Structuring (by Topic)

What it does: Ansuz rearranges and groups the transcript content based on the topics identified by the LLM.

Why it's important: Provides the primary value of a "reader-friendly" version by making the content navigable and understandable by theme rather than just time.

How it works at a high level:

Based on the LLM's output (identified topics and corresponding text segments), Ansuz re-structures the transcript.

Content related to each topic is grouped together under the LLM-generated heading.

The original wording and sequence within a specific topic segment should be largely preserved.

Feature: Information Preservation & Wording Integrity

What it does: Ensures that Ansuz's process of organizing the transcript does not remove original information or significantly alter the original wording. The focus is on structuring, not summarizing or rephrasing.

Why it's important: Maintains the accuracy and nuance of the original content, ensuring users can trust the output from Ansuz.

How it works at a high level:

LLM prompts will explicitly instruct against summarization or heavy rephrasing.

The primary transformation is the grouping and ordering of existing text blocks, not the generation of new text to replace old text (except for headings).

Mechanisms or checks might be needed to compare total content length or key phrases if feasible, though primary reliance is on LLM instruction.

Feature: Reader-Friendly HTML Output Generation

What it does: Ansuz produces a single, self-contained HTML document presenting the organized transcript.

Why it's important: HTML is universally viewable on all devices with a web browser and is easy to share. It allows for basic but effective formatting.

How it works at a high level:

Ansuz takes the structured content (topics, headings, associated text) and converts it into a valid HTML structure.

Uses standard HTML tags: <h1>, <h2> for topic headings, <p> for paragraphs.

Includes basic CSS for readability (e.g., font selection, line spacing, margins).

The HTML file is made available for the user to download from Ansuz.

# User Experience

User Personas:

Alex, the Student: Needs to review several hour-long lectures for an exam. Watching them all again is too time-consuming. Alex wants to use Ansuz to quickly find and review key topics discussed.

Brenda, the Busy Professional: Follows several industry podcasts but rarely has uninterrupted time. Brenda wants to use Ansuz to catch up on key insights during commutes by reading.

Chris, the Content Sharer: Watched an insightful 3-hour interview and wants to share the main points with colleagues who won't watch the whole thing. Chris needs Ansuz to generate a digestible summary of topics.

Key User Flows (MVP):

Ansuz generates an HTML file (if successful).

User is prompted to download/save the HTML file.

User opens the HTML file in a browser to view the organized transcript from Ansuz.

UI/UX Considerations (MVP):

Simplicity: The interface for Ansuz (whether CLI or basic GUI) should be straightforward and require minimal steps.

Clarity: Clear instructions for input, and clear indication of processing status and completion within Ansuz.

Readability of Output: The HTML generated by Ansuz must prioritize readability through good typography (font, size, line height), clear topic headings, and logical paragraph breaks.

Feedback: Ansuz should provide feedback to the user during processing (e.g., "Fetching transcript...", "Analyzing content...", "Generating document...") and clear error messages if something goes wrong.

Accessibility (Basic): Ensure the HTML output from Ansuz uses semantic tags for better accessibility.

User Stories (MVP):

As a user, I want to input a raw text transcript into Ansuz so that I can get an organized, readable version of it.

As a user, I want to provide a YouTube video link to Ansuz so that it automatically fetches its transcript and processes it.

As a user, I want the transcript processed by Ansuz to be organized by distinct topics with clear headings so that I can quickly navigate and understand the content.

As a user, I want the original wording of the transcript to be maintained by Ansuz so that I can trust the accuracy and nuance of the information.

As a user, I want the output from Ansuz to be a single HTML file so that I can easily share it and view it on any device with a web browser.

As a user, I want Ansuz to inform me if a transcript cannot be fetched from a YouTube link so I know why the process failed.

# Logical Dependency Chain

Foundation (Core Processing Logic with Text Input for Ansuz):

Step 1: Manual Text Input Mechanism: Ability to paste/load text into Ansuz (R1.1).

Step 2: Core LLM Integration (Topic Segmentation & Heading): Send text to LLM, get structured topic/content data back via Ansuz (R1.2). This is the highest risk and most crucial part. Start with very basic LLM calls and iterate.

Step 3: Basic HTML Output: Convert the LLM's structured output into a simple HTML page using Ansuz (R1.3, R1.4).

Step 4: Download HTML: Allow user to save the file from Ansuz (R1.5).

Goal: Achieve a minimal end-to-end flow with pasted text to verify the core concept of Ansuz.

Adding YouTube Input Source to Ansuz:

Step 5: YouTube Transcript Fetching: Implement YouTube URL input and transcript retrieval in Ansuz (R2.1, R2.2). Test this independently.

Step 6: Integrate YouTube Transcript with Core Processing: Feed the fetched transcript into the Ansuz LLM pipeline developed in Step 2 (R2.3).

Step 7: Error Handling for YouTube: Implement specific error messages in Ansuz for YouTube fetching issues (R2.4).

Adding File Input & Usability Enhancements to Ansuz:

Step 8: Text File Input: Allow uploading .txt files to Ansuz (R2.5). This leverages the same core processing as Step 1.

Step 9: UI/UX & HTML Styling Improvements: Refine the user interface (CLI/GUI) for Ansuz and improve HTML output aesthetics and readability (R1.6, R3.1, R3.3).

Step 10: LLM Prompt Refinement: Iterate on LLM prompts used by Ansuz based on testing with diverse transcripts (R3.2).

This order prioritizes getting a usable, visible front-end (even if CLI) for Ansuz that works with the core LLM logic as quickly as possible using the simplest input method (pasted text). Each subsequent feature builds upon this foundation.

# Risks and Mitigations

Risk: LLM Performance & Consistency for Topic Segmentation in Ansuz.

Challenge: LLMs can be unpredictable; achieving consistent and accurate topic segmentation and relevant headings across diverse transcript types and lengths can be difficult for Ansuz. Prompt engineering is key.

Mitigation:

Allocate time for iterative prompt engineering and testing with various transcripts for Ansuz.

Consider multi-step LLM approaches (e.g., first identify themes, then segment, then generate headings).

Explore different LLM models or parameters for Ansuz.

Set realistic expectations for accuracy in Ansuz MVP; perfect segmentation might not be achievable.

Risk: Reliability of YouTube Transcript Fetching for Ansuz.

Challenge: YouTube transcripts may not always be available, accurate, or auto-generated. The API/library might have limitations or change.

Mitigation:

Use a well-maintained library for transcript fetching within Ansuz.

Implement robust error handling and clear user messaging in Ansuz when transcripts are unavailable.

Have a fallback or clear indication if only auto-generated (potentially less accurate) transcripts are available.

Risk: Preserving Information Integrity & Original Wording with Ansuz.

Challenge: LLMs might naturally tend to summarize or rephrase if not carefully instructed by Ansuz.

Mitigation:

Craft LLM prompts for Ansuz that strongly emphasize organization and structure without altering or omitting original content.

Focus on re-ordering existing blocks of text under new headings rather than generating new prose.

Manual review of outputs from Ansuz during development to check for information loss.

Risk: Scope Creep for Ansuz MVP.

Challenge: Tendency to add "just one more thing" to the Ansuz MVP, delaying initial release.

Mitigation:

Strictly adhere to the defined MVP features for Ansuz.

Clearly document "Non-Goals (MVP)" and defer other features to "Future Enhancements" for Ansuz.

Regularly review progress against Ansuz MVP scope.

Risk: LLM API Costs (if using paid APIs for Ansuz).

Challenge: Processing long transcripts via paid LLM APIs can become expensive, especially during development and testing of Ansuz.

Mitigation:

Utilize free tiers or developer credits where possible during initial development of Ansuz.

Optimize LLM usage (e.g., batching, efficient prompting) within Ansuz.

Consider options for users to use their own API keys if Ansuz becomes a web service.

For Ansuz as a script/local app, this is less of an end-user concern but a development cost.

Explore smaller, fine-tunable open-source models if feasible for specific tasks within Ansuz.

Risk: Handling Diverse Transcript Quality and Formats by Ansuz.

Challenge: Real-world transcripts vary greatly in quality, speaker changes, presence of timestamps, noise, etc.

Mitigation:

For Ansuz MVP, focus on relatively clean, single-speaker or clearly delineated transcripts.

Add pre-processing steps if necessary (e.g., basic text cleaning) but keep simple for Ansuz MVP.

Acknowledge limitations in Ansuz handling extremely messy or poorly formatted transcripts in the MVP.

# Appendix

Research Findings:

Initial user request (transcript of conversation) indicates a clear need for transforming raw spoken content into a more digestible written format, a core function of Ansuz.

Common pain point: Raw transcripts are difficult to read and navigate due to lack of structure. Ansuz addresses this directly.

Preference for topic-based organization over purely chronological for better comprehension of long content, which is a key design principle for Ansuz.

Potential Technical Specifications (Initial Thoughts for Ansuz):

LLM Prompt Structure (Conceptual Example for Topic Segmentation in Ansuz):

System: You are an expert at analyzing conversation transcripts and organizing them by topic for the Ansuz application.
User:
Here is a transcript:
<transcript_text>

Your task for Ansuz is to:
1. Read the entire transcript to understand the main subjects discussed.
2. Identify distinct topics or segments within the conversation.
3. For each topic, provide a concise and descriptive heading (max 5-7 words).
4. Group the original transcript sentences/paragraphs under their respective topic headings.
5. IMPORTANT: Do NOT summarize, rephrase, or omit any part of the original transcript text. Preserve the original wording. The output should be the full transcript, just re-ordered and grouped under your generated topic headings.
6. Format your output as [Topic Heading 1]\n[Relevant text block 1]\n[Relevant text block 2]\n\n[Topic Heading 2]\n[Relevant text block 3]...
