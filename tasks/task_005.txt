# Task ID: 5
# Title: Create HTML output generation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop functionality to convert the structured content into a well-formatted, readable HTML document.
# Details:
Create an HTMLGenerator class that:
- Takes structured content as input
- Uses Jinja2 templates to generate HTML
- Applies basic CSS for readability (font selection, spacing, etc.)
- Produces a self-contained HTML file
Implement the HTML structure as outlined in the PRD appendix. Include CSS within the HTML file for portability. Add metadata like generation date and source (if available). Implement a method to save the HTML to a file with an appropriate filename.

# Test Strategy:
Validate HTML output against W3C standards. Test rendering in multiple browsers. Verify that the HTML correctly represents the structured content with appropriate headings and paragraphs.
