# Task ID: 4
# Title: Develop content structuring logic
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Create functionality to organize transcript content based on the topics identified by the LLM.
# Details:
Implement a ContentStructurer class that:
- Takes the raw transcript and LLM analysis as input
- Organizes transcript segments under appropriate topic headings
- Maintains the original sequence within each topic
- Preserves all original content without summarization
The structurer should create a hierarchical representation of the content that can be easily converted to HTML. Implement validation to ensure no content is lost during restructuring by comparing input and output text lengths (minus formatting).

# Test Strategy:
Compare input and output content to verify no information is lost. Test with transcripts containing clear topic shifts. Verify that the original wording and sequence within topics is maintained.
