# Task ID: 3
# Title: Implement LLM integration for topic segmentation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Integrate with an LLM API to analyze transcripts, identify topics, and generate appropriate headings.
# Details:
Create an LLMProcessor class that:
- Connects to the chosen LLM API (OpenAI recommended)
- Constructs effective prompts for topic segmentation as outlined in the PRD appendix
- Handles API responses and errors
- Parses LLM output into a structured format
The prompt should emphasize preserving original wording while identifying logical topic breaks. Implement a data structure to hold the segmented content (e.g., a list of dictionaries with 'heading' and 'content' keys). Include retry logic for API failures and timeout handling.

# Test Strategy:
Test with sample transcripts of varying length and complexity. Verify that topics are logically identified and that original wording is preserved. Check error handling by simulating API failures.
