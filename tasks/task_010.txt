# Task ID: 10
# Title: Create a simple CLI application
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Integrate all components into a cohesive command-line interface application with clear instructions and options.
# Details:
Develop a CLI using argparse or click that:
- Provides clear help documentation
- Offers options for different input methods (text, file, YouTube URL)
- Allows specifying output file location
- Includes optional flags for advanced settings
Implement a main function that orchestrates the workflow based on user input. Add a version flag and basic logging. Create a standalone executable using PyInstaller or similar for easy distribution.

# Test Strategy:
Test all CLI options and combinations. Verify help documentation is clear and comprehensive. Test the application end-to-end with various inputs and options. Get feedback from test users on usability.
