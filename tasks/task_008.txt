# Task ID: 8
# Title: Refine LLM prompts for better topic segmentation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4
# Priority: low
# Description: Iterate on and improve the LLM prompts to achieve more accurate topic segmentation and better heading quality.
# Details:
Analyze results from initial implementation and refine prompts by:
- Testing variations of prompt wording and structure
- Adding examples of good segmentation in the prompt
- Adjusting temperature or other LLM parameters
- Potentially implementing a multi-step approach (first identify themes, then segment)
Create a PromptLibrary class to manage different prompt templates and versions. Implement A/B testing to compare prompt effectiveness. Document the evolution of prompts and their impact on results.

# Test Strategy:
Compare results from different prompts using the same input transcripts. Evaluate heading quality, topic coherence, and segmentation accuracy. Get feedback from test users on the organization quality.
