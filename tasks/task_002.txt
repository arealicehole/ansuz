# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement text input handling
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create functionality to accept and process raw text input from users, either pasted directly or uploaded as a file.
# Details:
Develop an InputHandler class with methods for:
- Processing pasted text input
- Reading and validating text files (.txt)
- Basic text cleaning/normalization
- Input validation (checking for empty input, minimum length)
Implement a simple CLI interface that prompts users to either paste text or provide a file path. For file handling, use standard Python file operations with proper error handling for file not found or permission issues.

# Test Strategy:
Test with various text inputs including empty strings, very short texts, and longer transcripts. Test file reading with valid and invalid file paths. Verify input validation correctly identifies problematic inputs.
